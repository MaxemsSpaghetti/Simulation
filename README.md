## Project “Simulation”

The project is a step-by-step simulation of a 2D world populated by herbivores and predators.
The basic concept is to search for food by creatures, herbivores are looking for grass, carnivores are looking for herbivores.
Also, the world is filled with static objects, such as: earth, mountains, trees, and grass.

## Project features
The project implemented the A* (A-star) algorithm, 
which allows you to find the shortest path for the creature to the nearest victim.
It works for both predators and herbivores.

## Control features
- pause the simulation, press 'p'

- resume the simulation, press 'r'

- quit the simulation, press 'q'

## List of possible improvements

- the predator eats the herbivore not for 1 bite (not implemented due to the ugly display on the map)
- the presence of HP in creatures
- hunger mechanics, when creatures HP starts to decrease due to lack of food
- mechanics of reproduction
- alignment of the map so that the map is an even square
